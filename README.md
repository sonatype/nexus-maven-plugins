Mojo Commons
============

Set of reusable stuff for developing Maven Mojos. Currently with support for:

* "Bootstrapping" a SISU container from within a Mojo.
* LogBack module support (with Maven loglevel sync and bindings added)
* Static utility class to "sync" LogBack logging level to Maven's logging level
* Logback appender to append to Maven's log.

All the libraries are marked as optional, to not drag parts you don't need with this library.



Thanks, and have fun,
